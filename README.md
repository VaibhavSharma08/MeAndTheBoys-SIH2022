In India, road infrastructure is used to transport over 60% of total goods and 85% of total passenger traffic. Pothole related deaths have been increasing in our life because of the presence of heavy traffic and water on roads. Road safety is very low. In all big cities, an excuse for potholes on the road and the poor condition of roads is always set out by the heavy monsoon. The problem we are trying to solve is to reduce the accidents caused due to potholes.

Drivers can see the potholes when they are dry but they might get stuck in the potholes during the rainy season. So, the drivers should be able to see the potholes on the map on the current route to get the knowledge of any unrepaired pothole. The problem also requires uploading and updating the database of the potholes to allow the responsible authority to take necessary actions and fill the potholes at the earliest in order to prevent accidents and damage to life and property.
