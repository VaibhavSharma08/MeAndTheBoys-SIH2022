The problem we are trying to solve is to reduce the accidents due to potholes. Drivers can see the potholes when they are dry but they might get stuck in the potholes during the rainy season. So the drivers should be able to see the potholes on the map on the current route to get the knowledge of any unrepaired pothole. The problem also requires uploading and updating the database of the potholes to allow the responsible authority to take necessary actions and fill the potholes at the earliest possible to prevent accidents and damage to life and property.

Our idea addresses this problem by providing a platform for the drivers as well as the normal users to prevent accidents. Our idea proposes a platform where the drivers can track their live location on a live map and know the location of probable potholes in their way. The presence of markers representing the potholes would help the drivers to either slow down or choose any alternate path. Users can upload the image of the pothole that requires attention. We will record the image as well as the live location of the user to target the reported pothole. That image will be analyzed by our machine learning algorithm to decide the priority based on the different properties of the pothole such as the expected width and depth. This idea will also help the responsible authorities take necessary action to repair the potholes based on priority basis to prevent major mishappenings on more busy roads.
